//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);
/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);
/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers != numberStudents);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: Explain.
// You are asking the console to log result of the comparison of: if 4 is less than 9. It is a boolean output that will return with either True or False. True, in this case.

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// You are first assigning the variable books a number 3. You are then asking the console to tell you if 4 is greater than the number of books, (3). As a result of running this code, the return will be true.

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// One variable, friends, is assigned the numerical value of 6. The other, siblings, is asssigned the numerical value of 2. You then ask the console if the var friends is greater than the var siblings (true).

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// Assigning two variables, attendees and meals. Both are numerical values, 9 and 8. You are then comparing values to see if the attendees and meals do *not* strictly equal one another. They do not, so the console will log 'true.'


//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy

console.log(lovesToPlay && age);
// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: My final line of code evaluated to 1. This scenario falls into the set of rules that occur when logical operators are used to calculate non-boolean values. The first variable is a boolean value, and is 'true.' The second element is a number, non-boolean. The result of this string is 1 because && would only return the value of the first variable if it was false. In this case, it was true so the second variable was the return.

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect? yes.
