//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);
// this should log: true

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers)
// this should log: false

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?"), numberTeachers !== numberStudents;
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);
// this should log: false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);
// this should log: true


//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: This is asking if 4 is less than 9. True.

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: This declares the "books" variable as 3. Then it asks if 4 is less than "books" (which is 3). False.

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: This declares the variables "friends" and "siblings" as 6 and 2 respectively.
//         Then it asks if "friends" (6) is greater than "siblings" (2). True.

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: This declares the variables "attendees" and "meals" as 9 and 8 respectively.
//         Then it asks if "attendees" (9) is not equal to "meals" (8). True.

//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && age === 1)
// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: True. I typed lovesToPlay AND if the age strictly equals 1.

// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?

// Yes!
