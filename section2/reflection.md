## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. In the article they mention how making mistakes is essential to learning. So far in my coding
journey, this has been very true. Once you've been frustrated by a mistake, you aren't likely to fall into that trap again.
2. The article also mentions seeking out challenges, which I do often on the side to be sure the lessons I learn either through Turing or The Odin Project are sticking with me.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

1. I think I do a pretty good job of using my mistakes as opportunities to learn, especially when there are so many helpful resources online.
2. I could be better at setting more specific goals for myself.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

1. I felt very comfortable seeking out information for myself. I didn't really run into any trouble at any point. I did have to seek out a bit of help when forgetting to use a strict operator over the '=' alone.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

1. A conditional statement is an if-then statement. One example might be in signing up for a site. If you input your email address, the website checks to see if that email is associated with an account already. 'If' it is, 'then' it may prompt you to log in rather than create a new account.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

1. We can add multiple conditions to an if statement using && and || operators. The && statement is read from left to right, evaluating both sides to see if they are both true. The 'or' conditional is read from left to right, and will stop at the first truthy statement. We can also specify 'else if' and 'else' statements to be run if certain conditions are not met.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

1. I would use the && operator. For the second case, I would use the || operator.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
