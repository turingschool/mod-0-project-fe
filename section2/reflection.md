## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
+ The S.M.A.R.T really resonated with me. Not only was the acronym appropriate, but also seemed to allow for a reasonable accomplishments. Often times I bite off more than I can chew in one sitting, and have a tendency to try and get everything done far too quickly. This leads to a stage of burn-out, which can primarily make me feel like I'm not thriving.
+ Being less critical on myself for making mistakes is also something that is pretty foreign to me. Throughout the military we were taught that mistakes can be the meaning between life and death. There weren't a lot of options available to be anything less than critical of yourself or your work. This is a little bit of a new concept to me, and I'm going to try and adopt it into my everyday life when it comes to this future career.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
+ I already love to be in stressful situations, in the midst of stress and chaos is actually where I do my best work. I don't know if it's the military training or even having been in the medical field for years now-but I seem to accomplish more when the stakes are high. In this retrospect I meet a growth mindset, as I've adopted to feel comfortable even in uncomfortable situations and often time seek them out.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
+ Through memory and perhaps repetition and memory it was easy to formulate what was needed to be done. Funny enough I run node everytime I'm messing with code in atom till it became a Habit. I wanted to unsure that everything I changed had or will worked before even starting a submission. That way I can get used to seeing what minor mistakes I make, and how to ammend them in the future.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
+ A conditional statement is based on a concept of is/then/else; if a condition is met, then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something different. A daily life conditional EXAMPLE: "If I wake up and I'm hungry I'll eat something, else (if not) I won't."
```
var isHungry = true
var isAwake = true
if ((isHungry === true) && (isAwake === true)) {
  console.log("I'm going to make something to eat.")
} else {
  console.log("I'm not going to make anything to eat")
}
```
I think an example of a conditional in an application would have to be username and password for any login for facebook. If the login is wrong, than the statement would be that "Your login/password is wrong please try again.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
+ In order to add multiple conditions to an `if` statement you would put `else if` or `else`. The program could also use comparison operators to apply the conditions of the `else if` statements as true or false. For instance in an `if` statement, if the first condition is `false` it moves onto the next, which is usually an `else` or `else if`. This process continues until one of the statements is/or becomes true.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
+ Comparison operators and logical comparison operators can both be used to check that two conditions are met. For instance: ``||`` and ``&&`` are the two logical operators available.
+ ``||`` is an OR: this operator tests at least one condition-If either expression evaluates to true, then the expression returns ``true``. If both are ``false``, then the expression will be ``false``.
+ ``&&`` is an AND: this operator tests more than one condition-If both expressions evaluate to a ``true`` then the expression returns ``true``. If just one of these returns ``false``, then the expression will return false.
+ ``!`` is a logical NOT: this operator takes a single boolean value and inverts it.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
+ I do not have any questions, I just need to practice more in order to become more comfortable with these dev tools.
