## Section 2 Reflection

1. *What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?*
- Recognizing whether I have a fixed or growth mindset was enlightening for me. I have had to unlearn many fixed mindset habits that have prevented me from picking up or learning something new. Looking back, I felt very stagnant and stuck in my ways when it came to my career and personal life. As I learn to code, it has been a total mindshift for me and I didn’t realize that I am already applying growth mindset in developing my new skills and how I approach problems. By recognizing that I can grow and change, I can do things differently to improve myself.

- Having a growth mindset is being open to feedback and suggestions. Asking help from other people will help expedite my learning process.

2. *In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?*
- Since starting this journey, I’ve had to do a lot of self-reflection to gain a deeper understanding of my limitations and why I feel I have those limitations. I’ve realized that I need to change how I behave when I face new challenges. I’ ve learned to accept my mistakes and to stop feeling discouraged. I’ve also learned to seek out help instead of waiting when I’ve been stuck on the a problem for too long.
- I think a part of me is still afraid to seek out challenges. I still prefer staying in my comfort zone. I think seeking out new projects and thinking of personal projects I can work on would help me practice my skills and even learn new things beyond my current undestanding. I plan on reserving time for this so I can work on this.

3. *In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?*
- Not having the extra guidance provided in section 1 forced me to figure things out on my own when opening the directory and files on the terminal. I took this as a challenge for me to try new things. I found a way to open the mod-0-project-fe file on Visual Studio Code which allows me to see all of the sections. This way I can look at instructions in section 1 while also going into section 2. I think this supported my learning by encouraging me to figure out things on my own, double check my work, and use resources.

4. *What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.*

Conditional statements allow my code to make decisions about what to do next. It checks for a specific condition and executes the code based on the specified condition. In Javascript, these include `if` ,`else` ,`else if` and `switch` statements. 

An example of a conditional I consider in my daily life is:

- If I drink coffee in the morning, then I have more energy to be productive.

- If I do not drink coffee in the morning, then I need to take a nap later.

Netflix will typically stream a video for as long as this application is open on my phone. Conditions would have a role in how this works as well! 

- If I press “pause” , the video stops playing.
- If I press “play”, the video will start playing again.
- If I press “next episode”, the video will stop and start loading a new video to play.

5. *How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.*
- To add multiple conditions to an if statement, I need to add else if or else. I use else if when I want to specify a new condition inside the parentheses. The program will evaluate the conditions same as in the if statement until it finds a specific condition that is true. I use else when I want to set a default. When the program does not find any matches, it will execute the else code block. The computer will check every if/else statement so more than one condition may come back true so it is important to test my code.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- Logical operators allows me to check multiple conditions at once. The logical AND (&&) operator will check that two conditions are met to return true. The logical OR (||) operator will check that 1 or 2 conditions are met to return true. If the conditions met are true, then the program will run the code block.

7. *What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?*
![Minion saying Whaat?](https://c.tenor.com/QZ_Y6lgscxIAAAAM/what-minion.gif)
- What limitations do if/else statements have?
- When do I use the if/else versus switch statement?
- When would you want to use non-boolean values in logical operators?
