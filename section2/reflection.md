## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Recognize that I have a choice: we are used to trying to protect ourselves from failure so we don't get
hurt. In the Growth Mindset we choose to try, to grow, to do it.
- Challenge yourself: Instead of just doing what is expected from you, accept the challenge and learn with it.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Ways I do: Believing in myself and deciding that I can do it, practicing more and more, and not asking for approval from others.
Ways I don't: When I have doubts about my strategies, my intelligence. When I think I will fail.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I was kinda lost in the beginning, but I gave it a try. What I didn't understand at first, I read again more carefully and researched a little bit more. That showed me that I am capable of doing it.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
Conditional statement is a part of the syntax that allow us to run blocks of code if a condition is met.
A daily life conditional is: If it is 7 am and I am still sleeping I will be late for work. hahaha
An example of a conditional in a web application that I use is: user and password, if it is true you will be able to access the page, if not you will have to try again/register/reset password to be able to access it.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
You use && or || to include multiple conditions to a if statement.
If you use && the program runs the conditionals in order until it finds whether is true or false, if all the condition are true the statement will be true, if one of them is false, the statement will be false.
If you use || the program runs the conditionals in order until it finds whether is true or false, if all the condition are true the statement will be true, if one of them is false, the statement will also be true since is asking for one or another.
If all the conditions are true will run the block of code below it, if it is false will run the block of code that will be after the 'else'.
Sometimes if we want to add conditions after the first conditions are evaluated we can replace 'else' with 'else if' and add the conditions there.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
The tools we have are the Conditional statements && or ||.
We can try to run the conditions separately and see what the output is.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I don't really understand what tools are available to me to check if the conditions are met if I don't run the code (see question 6)
