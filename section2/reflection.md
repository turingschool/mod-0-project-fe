## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

*One thing that stood out to me about Growth Mindset was Zone of Proximal Development. Also being able to look at mistakes or failures as opportunities to learn a grow.*

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*I think my ability to understand that mistakes are learning experiences is a demonstration of a Growth Mindset. I could be better at using S.M.A.R.T as a goal setting tool.*

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

*At first I was trying to remember how to do some things but after recalling proper procedures I felt accomplished and proud that some of the training wheels are coming off.*

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

*If I need groceries, then I would go to the grocery store. If I did not need groceries, then I would stay home. Spotify suggests "This band" if you liked "This other band."*

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.

*If the first "if" statement results in false, the program will check to see if additional conditions, denoted by an "else if" statement, are true or not. "Else if" is used when you want to specify a response to another specific possible input. An "else" statement prompts a response to any input other than the ones specified in the "If" and "Else if" statements.*

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

*Here we can use logical operators for "AND" and "OR", denoted "&&" and "||" respectively.*

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
