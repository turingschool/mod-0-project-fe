## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * Resonated: “Growth-minded individuals may be more apt to practice more often, persevere in the face of difficulty, and accept critical feedback.” The ability to pause and acknowledge an issue before trying to work against it makes you more aware of how you analyze things.
  * New to me: “Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals helps you to approach learning to code with clarity, focus, and use of appropriate strategies (Rubin, 2002).” It blows my mind that I have never heard of SMART goals up until now. I can see how dialing in a goal this way would be beneficial not only to coding but all aspects of life.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  >If I’m being honest with myself, having a growth-mindset has not been my main focus in the past. Up until recently, I was just going through the motions everyday. That’s not to say that I wasn’t constantly working on personal growth; the pandemic forced me to look inward and figure out who/what was important to me and how I wanted to show up in the world. Now, I’m on a journey to invest in myself and expand my mind which turns out to be very rewarding. That alone feels like the start of having a growth-mindset. I’m learning how to set SMART goals (embarrassingly enough, I had never heard of this acronym before now), break down projects into smaller more palatable chunks, and how to accept critical and constructive feedback. I’m learning that perfectionism is stagnating and mistakes are critical to learning. They should be used as a stepping stone, not a set back.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  >At no point did I feel _uncomfortable_, per se. I felt confident in running the node command even though it took me a couple of tries from memory. The vague instructions helped me with memory recall and understanding how each section/skill builds on itself. I feel like I've gained insight into my own learning style, my strengths and weaknesses, and how I can leverage all of them to succeed. It's empowering, actually.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  * A conditional statements evaluate `true` or `false` and commonly use comparison operators such as `===`, `!==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.
  * A daily life example would be to ask myself, "Are the dishes clean?" If yes (or `true`), then great! There's no work to be done. If no (or `false`), then it looks like I'll be doing some dishes.
  * A web application that I use often is Spotify. An example of a conditional statement there would be the now playing function. If the play button is pressed, play music. If the play button is not pressed, do not play music.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  * You can add multiple conditions to an `if...else` statement by using `else if` statements where there are multiple conditions and code blocks that will run depending on if the previous statement is evaluated as `true` or `false`.
  * The program reads them line by line. If the initial `if` conditional statement is true, we stop there. If it's `false` then we move to the next code block to evaluate the second condition. That code block will run if evaluated as `true`. If it results in `false` we move again to the next code block to evaluate a third condition, and so on and so forth.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  * If I wanted to check if two conditions are met, I would use the AND logical operator `&&`
  * If I wanted to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, I would use the OR logical operator `||`

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  * Why do we use a space after the `if` statement but not after `console.log`?
