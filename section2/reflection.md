## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  **Striving to improve with my ZPD and focusing on the process are two points that resonated the most with me.  I feel like I learn and retain things more when I am challenged.  Learning how to get over the hurdle really reassures my trust in the process.  Mistakes are going to be apart of it and Ishould embrace those emotions that come with it, but also to continue to keep trying and trust in the process that I will improve and be better.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  **I think demonstrate an understanding that mistakes are apart of the learning process but I do have a hard time in asking for help.  It's not because I am afraid to ask for help.  I think I feel like I might be missing an opportunity to learn something a certain if I dont ask for help and spend a little more time in trying to get it myself.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  **At first I did not feel very well about it.  I would get something and feel comfortable and then move onto the next thing and it would feel like I completely missed something.  Overall though it helped. I feel like it empowers me to discover the answer and figure it out for myself and that it's okay I dont know what this is yet, but I can figure it out and learn it.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  **A conditional statement is a command that tells the computer to execute certain actions, provide that certain conditions are met.  A daily life conditional would be if I had 2 cups of creamer, then I would be able to have coffee.  If I had less than 2 cups of creamer then I would not be able to have coffee. A web application that uses conditionals facebook if having the correct login information gives you access to your profile; else you dont have access if you have the wrong login information.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  **You add multiple conditions to an if statement by using 'else if'.  When dealing with multiple conditions, a program will determine if the variable makes certain conditions true or false.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  **I can use the Chrome Dev Tools Console to check if conditions are met before running code.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  **If i am using conditional statements do I always have to end them with 'else' ?
