## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  **At first I did not feel very well about it.  I would get something and feel comfortable and then move onto the next thing and it would feel like I completely missed something.  Overall though it helped. I feel like it empowers me to discover the answer and figure it out for myself and that it's okay I dont know what this is yet, but I can figure it out and learn it.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  **A conditional statement is a command that tells the computer to execute certain actions, provide that certain conditions are met.  A daily life conditional would be if I had 2 cups of creamer, then I would be able to have coffee.  If I had less than 2 cups of creamer then I would not be able to have coffee. A web application that uses conditionals facebook if having the correct login information gives you access to your profile; else you dont have access if you have the wrong login information.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  **You add multiple conditions to an if statement by using 'else if'.  When dealing with multiple conditions, a program will determine if the variable makes certain conditions true or false.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  **I can use the Chrome Dev Tools Console to check if conditions are met before running code.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  **If i am using conditional statements do I always have to end them with 'else' ?
