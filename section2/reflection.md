## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

One point from the article that really resonated with me was the implementation of SMART goals. I can appreciate how overwhelming and seemingly insurmountable certain projects might feel when viewed in their entirety, and I know that I can be affected by larger projects in that way. So, I feel that I will benefit greatly from practicing breaking these projects into smaller, more digestible pieces that exist on a tangible timeline not only as a Turing student, but also as a team member in my future career.

A second point from the article that resonated with me wasn't necessarily a new concept generally speaking; however, I really appreciated the article turning this concept towards coding. I am a big fan of self reflection, turning inward, and spending time with myself intentionally to learn more about my behaviors, tendencies, and way of being. This practice has helped me to grow so much, and I can absolutely see the paralleled value of setting aside a certain amount of scheduled time to intentionally reflect on my coding process. This is a skillset that demands a commitment to lifelong learning, and I think I used to view that learning primarily as something external: learning new languages, new platforms, how to work with different people, etc. However, this article and this point in particular helped me see the internal aspect of this learning, and I'm excited by it!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I practice self reflection. I believe in my ability to improve any skillset with practice and commitment, and I believe in my ability to overcome and persevere in the face of challenges. However, I do find a certain stubbornness in myself when it comes to asking for help, and, if I'm not careful, I can ruminate on mistakes instead of celebrating them as learning opportunities.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I noticed and appreciated the change in the direction's detail. Although I was uncomfortable with some of the language/terminology, it prompted me to review my notes, Google, and essentially rely radically on myself before asking for help - all which further cemented not only the technical skills we've practiced thus far, but also the "growth mindset" techniques we reviewed in this section!

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A statement that tells the program to execute a certain block oof code pending on whether or not a condition or multiple conditions are met.

A daily life conditional:
You want to put dirty dishes in your dishwasher. If the dishwasher is full, empty it before you put dirty dishes in it. If the dishwasher is empty, put your dirty dishes in it.

YouTube's homepage:
If you hover a video, enlarge it slightly and play it silently. If you do not hover over a video, display the thumbnail at a set dimension.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add a second condition, you can use an 'if else' statement. To add three or more conditions, you can sandwich your 'if else' statement with one or more 'else if' statements.

In an example with an 'if' statement, followed by an 'else if' statement, followed by an 'else' statement, the program reads the code and determines how to proceed as follows:
Evaluate the first condition. Is it true? If it's true, run the following block of code. If it is false, evaluate the second condition. If it's true, run the following block of code. Otherwise, run the following block of code.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

If I want to check if two conditions are met, or if I want to check that one of two conditions are met, I can use the logical operators && and || respectfully in my 'if' statement.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Can logical operators be used to evaluate more than two variables in one condition?
