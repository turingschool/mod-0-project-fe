## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

+ Learning to code is not a destination, but an ongoing, never-ending process, and part of being a software engineer is integrating the Growth Mindset into our daily mental habits so that you are comfortable continuously operating in that state.

+ Challenges are to be welcomed, they will be an integral part of the coding work, whether in debugging code, learning new language, or refining skills.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

+ Do: Learning a new skill is exciting to me. I am typically very eager to learn, practice, and problem solve.

+ Don't: When there is a lot of information that is unfamiliar to me, I tense up / resist exploring it instead of welcoming the idea of new territory. My mental habit is to look forward to the destination / time when I'm comfortable with it all or a "pro" rather than reveling in the process.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

+ I actually hadn't noticed until this prompt, which is encouraging that I knew how to do it from memory.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

+ A statement which determines which code will run based on the outcome

+ Ex: "I am hungry," if True: eat, if False: don't eat.

+ "Add Guacamole," if True: add $2 to total, if False: keep total the same

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

+ By using "if / else" conditions.  

+ `if` condition 1 is met, then first function runs; `if else` condition 2 is met, then a second function runs; `if else` condition 3 is met, then a third function runs; `else` no conditions are met, then an additional function runs.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

+ Logical operators: `&&` checks conditions with an "and" statement (two conditions), `||` compares conditions set with an "or" statement (one of two conditions)

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
None at this time.
