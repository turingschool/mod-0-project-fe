## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- In Kristin Villanuava's blog part 1, she discusses using the Zone of Proximal Development method. This makes a lot of sense when it comes to effectively and efficiently developing a skill set.

- In part 2, she discusses that understanding that there is always room to grow will give you the mindset essential for becoming an effective programmer.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I would say I'm a very eager learner and enjoy practicing as well as not being a quitter. In my youth, I was more comfortable with giving up on something but as an adult my eagerness to learn has helped me persevere and not give up on tasks.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It felt fine. I did have to go back and look at the node file path from section 1 to remember it exactly but I doubt I will have to do that anymore. I liked the more vague directions. It challenged me, which is what I wanted so that I could see where I was at.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is when a "condition" must be met in order for a piece of code to execute. If the condition isn't met, the next condition is evaluated to determine if a condition is met and so on.

An example in daily life: If you don't renew your driver's license by a specified date, you will not legally be permitted to drive.

Rosetta Stone language learning uses conditionals to determine if you have grasped enough of the lesson to move onto the next lesson or you must go over the lesson again.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

the first condition is read as "if 'condition' is met," code will execute, "else if," test next condition and so on.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

logical operators such as && to determine if "condition" and "condition" are met and || to determine if "condition" or "condition" are met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I mostly get it but I'm not 100% on when to end a conditional with just "else."
