## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

i really liked this set of essays. the cyclical nature of learning to code better which in turn helps you learn more, which helps you code better...  and that because of the nature of technology, coding isn't something you're ever 'done' learning.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

every so often i will pick up a new hobby and I will learn the shit out of it. i focus on it and develop my skills and understand it inside and out. just when i come to be proficient at that skill I will get bored and drop it. i do not seem to have the grit it takes to continue pursuing something once i feel like i've got it down pat.
coding seems to be a bottomless pit of things to learn, so that's encouraging.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

i did notice that. mostly it was fine and i found my way around to get the info i needed, which is good experience. on the other hand, when i couldn't find the info i needed, or i broke something in a way i couldn't fix, i found myself frustrated.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

in life:
is it raining?
if yes, grab a bumbershoot.
if no, grab sunglasses.

in twitter:
is user verified?
if yes, add little check mark to their profile
if no, get lost loser

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

it basically goes down the list checking each option. is it this one? no, next! this one? nope. how about this? ooh that's the one. yeah buddy. go down that line of reasoning/code.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

i would do "if A && B" are both of these true? ok lets go.
and "if A || B" is at least one of these good? alrighty then.


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

it's going to take me a while to get the nuances of == vs === and a couple other small things, but mostly i think i get it.
