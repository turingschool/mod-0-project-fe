## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you? Two points that resonated with me are the S.M.A.R.T
goals tactic and the idea of understanding that you are going to make mistakes
along the way. I think the smart goals idea is good toe help not lose focus of an
objective and to not get overwhelmed with a big project. It think it is key in
understanding that mistakes are the way to learning, I know that I am finding this
out quickly in my first couple weeks at Turing

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
 I currently try to demonstrate a growth Mindset by believing that I
can improve my skills with effort and practice, try to understand that mistakes are
critical to learning and by setting smart goals for myself. I think that I do not
show a growth mindset currently by seeking out challenges, at this point in the
program due to working a full time job I have been trying to just get everything
done. I havenâ€™t had the time to fully jump in.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning? it felt good to get in a groove of learning to find an answer for something on my own. First I go back and check the notes provided, if I do not see anything then I begin to look on google for instructions.  So far I have found I am able to answer more all my own questions with a little work

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.Conditional statements evaluate to true or false.this can be done by using a number of different operators- strictly equal, not equal, greater than, etc.  A web example would be someone signing into a banking website and selecting from a list of languages

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do. Use either && or || i.e. logical AND or logical OR operator to connect two or more conditions inside a if statement. you just need to make sure your conditions are wrapped in parenthesis

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code? if else statements

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions? i still feel a little bit fuzzy making sure that I am writing out my coding correct for if else statements.  I think this should improve with more practice and getting a better grasp of the logic behind it
