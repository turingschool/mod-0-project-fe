## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  -   Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound (S.M.A.R.T.) goals is a new approach that I believe would be very beneficial when working on larger tasks.

  -   "Never compare yourself to someone else, instead you should track your own progress." Having this perspective changes the mindset into something inspiring and motivational rather than intimidating and out of reach resulting in a complete 180 approach to challenges.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

    Zone of Proximal Development is an accurate term of how I approach learning something new. When the challenge arises I always see what skills I have in my repertoire and strive to improve them, never becoming complacent. Eventually getting to the point where the challenge seems achievable. I then repeat this process until I consider the subject mastered.

    The _"seeking help"_ aspect of growth mindset is something I have always struggled with. My past careers have required an extreme amount of self reliance, however entering a whole new world and career I am working on welcoming the idea of asking for help and helping others.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

    Removing some of the support I had in section 1 made me a bit eager to see how much information I retained from the previous
    section. There were a few points I did get stuck or received error messages, however it gave me the opportunity to read through
    the error codes and problem solve on my own. In the end it reminded me what resources I have available to me while also giving me a little confidence boost.


4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

    A conditional statement is a two part statement that questions a variable with only a true or false answer outcome. The second part is a result based on the outcome of the first question.


  *Daily Life Example:*
IF I am feeling a little sleepy, THEN I will take a nap.

  *Web Application Example:*
If a user clicks on a "thumbs up" icon under a youtube video, then the next video to play will be something in relation.
If a user clicks a "thumbs down" icon under a youtube video, then the web application will not show anything in relation.


5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  In order to add multiple conditions to an `if` statement you need to add an `else if` command that will add a new value to your variable with a new expected outcome. The program will then question if the value is "true" based on the first `if` variable assignment. If the input is in fact true, the code will stop.
  If the value is "false" the program will then move to the next `else if` command to see if it can determine a "true" value. If the program can determine this value to be true the console.log will read whatever the `else if` assigned outcome is. However, if the program determines this value input to be "false" as well it will then move on to the next command. Repeating this process until it can determine a "true" value.


6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  -   Writing a syntax using the `&&` logical operator between your variables and running it using the Node command or in the Google Dev Tools will check to see if the conditions of those variables can be determined true or false.
  -   Writing a syntax using the `||` logical operator between your variables and running it using the Node command or in Google Dev Tools will test the condition on the left variable first to determine if it is true or false.


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

    Is there ever a limit on `else if` commands you can log?
