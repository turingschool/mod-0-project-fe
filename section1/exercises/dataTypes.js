//-------------------
//STRINGS
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to log the String "Alan Turing" in the console:
console.log("Alan Turing");

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to log `Welcome to Turing!` in the console:
console.log('Welcome to Turing!');

// YOU DO: Write code below to log `99 bottles of pop on the wall...`:
console.log('99 bottles of pop on the wall...')

// YOU DO: Write code below to log one line from your favorite song or movie:
console.log("Don't stop believing. Listen to that feeling...YEAH")


//-------------------
//NUMBERS
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the sum of 2 and 2 to the console:
console.log(2 + 2); //result: 4

// EXAMPLE: log the result of 7 subtracted from 83 to the console:
console.log(83 - 7); //result: 76

// YOU DO: log the result of 6 multiplied by 53 to the console:
console.log(6 * 53); //result: 318

// YOU DO: log the result of 20 divided by 4 to console:
console.log(20 / 4); //result: 5

// YOU DO: log the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
console.log(54 % 10); //modulo returns the remainder of after (integer) division. 10 can be subtracted from 54 five times, and 4 remains.

//-------------------
// BOOLEANS
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: log to the console the result of 1 is equal to 2:
console.log(1 === 2); //false

// EXAMPLE: log to the console the result of 7 is greater than 2:
console.log(7 > 2); //true

// YOU DO: log to the console the result of "hello" is equal to "Hello":
console.log('hello' === 'Hello'); //false
console.log('hello' == 'Hello') //false

// YOU DO: log to the console the result of 3 is not equal to 4:
console.log(3 !== 4); //true, checks data type and value
console.log(3 != 4); //true, check value only

// YOU DO: log to the console the result of 4 is less than or equal to 5:
console.log(4 <= 5); //true


//-------------------
// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console 
// as you would expect? *Yes*
