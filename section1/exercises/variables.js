// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22 + 2;
console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts";
console.log(warning);

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = "Johnny"
var isHungry = true
var numberOfPets = 4
console.log(firstName)
console.log(isHungry)
console.log(numberOfPets)

// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.
  //firstName is easy i just chose a common first named
  // isHungry sounds like a question so i answered true
  // numberOfPets is asking for a specific number so i gave it a value of 4


// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = "david"
var isHungry = false
var numberOfPets = 24

console.log(firstName)
console.log(isHungry)
console.log(numberOfPets)

// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;

var totalSnacks = 6+8
console.log(totalSnacks)
