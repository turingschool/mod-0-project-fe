In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
to achieve the desired result.

A couple examples that are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

When navigated to the root of this project directory, you should be able to run this

*/


// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22 + 2;
console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var harryPotterQuote = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts";
console.log(harryPotterQuote);

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = "Harry";
var isHungry = "Harry";
var numberOfPets = 4;
console.log(firstName);
console.log(isHungry);
console.log(numberOfPets);

// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.
 // he data types I decided to use were based off of what the variable was defining.
// Varibales that were people were strings because they used letters. # of pets
// used the data type of a Number since it could be defined as one.

// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
firstName = "Ron"; //change variable `firstName`
isHungry = "Ron"; // change variable `isHungry`
numberOfPets = 11; // change variable `numberOfPets`

// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;
var totalSnacks = junkFoodSnacks + healthySnacks;
console.log(healthySnacks);
console.log(junkFoodSnacks);
console.log(totalSnacks);
