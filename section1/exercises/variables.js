// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and

// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = "Betul";
console.log(firstName);
var isHungry = true;
console.log(isHungry);
var numberOfPets = 1;
console.log(numberOfPets);


// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
/* I decided by checking variable names what I need to do.
  String data is logged to the console as a result of line 33 by looking at the variable's name.
  firstName  It is required to answer with a name consists letters.
  Boolean data is logged to the console as a result of line 35 by looking at the variable's name.
  isHungry, it seems like a question; it is needed answer True or False.
  Number data is logged to the console as a result of line 37 by looking at the variable's name.
  numberOfPets It is required to answer with a number .    */

// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = "Togo";
console.log(firstName);
var isHungry = false;
console.log(isHungry);
var numberOfPets = 0;
console.log(numberOfPets);


// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;
//var totalNumberOfSnacks = healthySnacks + junkFoodSnacks;
//console.log(totalNumberOfSnacks);
console.log(healthySnacks + junkFoodSnacks);
