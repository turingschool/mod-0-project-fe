In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
to achieve the desired result.

One example is already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

// EXAMPLE: Write code that combines the variables below into another string:
var name = "Ron";
var team = "Chudley Cannons";

console.log("The " + team + " are " + name + "'s favorite Quidditch team");

// YOU DO: Read the next few lines of code...
var numberOfCreatures = 7;
var creatures = "unicorns";

console.log("My zoo has " + numberOfCreatures + " " + creatures + "!");

// YOU DO: What data type will be logged to the console as a result of line 22? Explain.
// Your answer and explanation here:
//"My zoo has 7 unicorns!" is a combination of Numeric Data and String Data.
//The value '7' is the sum of 'numberOfCreatures' therefore making it Numeric Data.
//The value 'unicorn' and '!' are String Data because they consist of letters and characters and are surrrounded by quotations.


// YOU DO:
// Write code that combines the variables below into a string that
// reads "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog":
var speedy = "quick red fox";
var slowPoke = "lazy brown dog";

console.log("The " + speedy + " jumped over the " + slowPoke);

// YOU DO:
// Write code that combines the variables below into a string that
// reads "In a predictable result, the tortoise beat the hare!"
// Note that we are omitting the var keyword below, because we are re-assigning the variables
slowPoke = "tortoise";
speedy = "hare";

console.log("In a predictable result, the " + slowPoke + " beat the " + speedy+"!") //reassigned the values

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, name/content/data type of your choice. Think carefully about what
  // you name the variables. Remember, the goal is to be concise but descriptive (it's a hard balance!)
  // Then, log out ONE sentence that incorporates all THREE variables.
var friend = "Dwight Schrute"; // best friend
var inventory = 3333456; // amount of beets grown annually
var vegetables = "beetsðŸ§…"; // produce harvested

console.log('My best friend '+friend+ ' grows '+inventory+ ' heirloom ' +vegetables+ ' per year.');

// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
  // as you would expect? You should be doing this by now, and getting into the habit of it.
  //Of course!
