// EXAMPLE: Write code that combines the variables below into another string:
var name = "Ron";
var team = "Chudley Cannons";

console.log("The " + team + " are " + name + "'s favorite Quidditch team");

// YOU DO: Read the next few lines of code...
var numberOfCreatures = 7;
var creatures = "unicorns";

console.log("My zoo has " + numberOfCreatures + " " + creatures + "!")

// YOU DO: What data type will be logged to the console as a result of line 22? Explain.
// Your answer and explanation here:
//"My zoo has 7 unicorns!" the variables reference the ascosiated data and return the values "7" and "unicorns" to fit with  ine sentence string.

// YOU DO:
// Write code that combines the variables below into a string that
// reads "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog":
var speedy = "quick red fox";
var slowPoke = "lazy brown dog";
console.log("The " + speedy + " jumped over the " + slowPoke + ".");

// YOU DO:
// Write code that combines the variables below into a string that
// reads "In a predictable result, the tortoise beat the hare!"
// Note that we are omitting the var keyword below, because we are re-assigning the variables

slowPoke = "tortoise";
speedy = "hare";
console.log("In a predictable result, the " + slowPoke + " beat the " + speedy);

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, name/content/data type of your choice. Think carefully about what
  // you name the variables. Remember, the goal is to be concise but descriptive (it's a hard balance!)
  // Then, log out ONE sentence that incorporates all THREE variables.
var animal = "Leopards";
var verb = "Eat";
var bodyPart = "Face";

console.log("'I never thought " + animal + " would " + verb + " MY " + bodyPart + "', Said woman who voted for the " + animal + " " + verb + "ing People's " + bodyPart + "s party.");

//oh man that could get weird switching the variables D:

//-------------------
// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console -- Yes i did.
  // as you would expect? You should be doing this by now, and getting into the habit of it.
