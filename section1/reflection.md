## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
   I believe I'm somewhere in between these days. I often feel self-conscious when I have a question that I think may sound dumb, so I'll keep it to myself until I'm alone and can research it. As an adult, I'm realizing that more often than not someone else has the same question, so there's no reason in being shy. I like the idea of only allowing myself only 20 minutes of struggle time before reaching out to a fellow classmate.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  *string - this contains at least one letter plus other characters (can include emojis or special characters) within quotation marks. Can be double quotes or single quotes, but the opener/closer mark must be the same.
  *number - any number! Can be positive (ie. 47), negative (ie. -27), decimal (ie. 0.25), or large without a comma (ie. 9845)
  *Boolean - these help us determine what script to run based on a true or false statement

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
   `console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
   // allows you to write a single line of comment where as /* ... */ allows you to write multiple wrapped lines of comment. The purpose is to allow you makes notes to other programmers or be able to block out chunks of code in a script.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
   A variable is where values are stored and changed if needed. For example, the variable would be 'person' where person could be defined as me, Amber, or the no-named 5 year old.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
   Spotify is the app I use most often and three variables could be artist, song, and number of plays. The artist and song would be string data types and the number of plays would be a number data type.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
   Concatenation is joining together multiple strings using the '+' operator and quotation marks.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
   Keeping with my most frequented app, Spotify, I think concatenation would be used on my home page where Daily Mixes are created. Under the "Daily Mix 1" I can see that there are several artists strung together to show me who is on the playlist.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
   I noticed a semicolon after each line of code we wrote, is this necessary or can it be left off? What's its purpose?
