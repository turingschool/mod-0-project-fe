## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

+ My tendency is to ask questions too soon, but with a new skill like working with computer software, it is sometimes out of fear that any fixes I try to attempt might have bad consequences to my machine. The standard of not searching longer than 30 minutes for a solution is a useful goal for me to work toward.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

+ **Number** - any character that is a numerical value (whole number, decimals, negative numbers)
+ **String** - a series of characters enclosed in matching quotation marks (either single or double)
+ **Boolean** - what can be assigned to a true or false answer

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

+ `console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

+ `// `
+ code comments are used to annotate sections of code to make reading or explaining them easier, eithe to yourself or to other developers

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

+ A variable is like a little box in which you store and label certain types of data to use later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Facebook
```
var loginName = "Example" (string)
var correctPassword = true (boolean)
var loginsToday = 1 (number)
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

+ **Concatenation** is using previously defined variables to create a string data type in the console log by using `+`

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

+ On any app that uses custom, private account for their users (eg: a food delivery platform)
`"Welcome back Scott Gaines!"`

```
var firstName = "Scott"
var lastName = "Gaines"

console.log("Welcome Back " + firstName + " " + lastName + "!")
```

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

+ None at this time! It's all making sense.
