## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between? I typically feel ok asking questions.  Currently in starting school with Turing I have felt I dont know what questions to ask yet but I feel comfortable asking.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each. The data types I learned about in this section are string, boolean, and number. Number data is self explanitory I feel and just contains numbers.  Boolean data is data that evaluates the info to either true or false values. String data can combine numbers and other characters all in one

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log(`Hello World!`);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// text //
/* text */
a code comment is used to allow us to add more information and it can show intentions or reasoning.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is something that allows you to store a more complex value information and use it more than once.  I would explain this to a 5 year old as a stamp that is dipped in ink.  Once dipped you can transpose the same thing over and over again with ease, the same text or image would appear each time.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
A site that I use frequently would be fantasy football dashboard.  I think it would likely use variables for username identification, weekly team matchups, and team name identification
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is. A concatenation i like to think of like smashing two things together to make one.  I have some experience using this term in microsoft excel

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
I would frequently use this in reporting in my previous role for data analytics on microsoft excel.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) I still have questions about how much we will focus on each of these lessons moving forward.  Which is most critical to hone in on now and how much repetition is needed to really start to take on this new muscle memory
