## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
    I like to work on problems on my own first before I ask questions. In the past, I have gotten caught up on a problem for several hours before I ask for help. Reading the articles helped me realize that waiting too long to ask a question is not an efficient use of my time. I think 20 minutes is a good amount of time to try solving a problem on my own before asking a question. I am working on formulating my questions so that I know what to research and what answer I am looking for. 
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
    I learned about strings, numbers, and booleans. 
      * Strings use quotation marks around letters and characters, which are useful for logging out messages. 
      * Numbers are whole numbers, integers, and decimals that are useful for making calculations. 
      * Booleans are true or false values that the computer recognizes when answering yes/no questions.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
    ```
    console.log("Hello World!")
    ```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
    Code comments are used for explaining your code. They also help communicate to other developers or your future self why you wrote your code this way. Here are ways to write code comments:
    1. Multi-line comments: use /* */ to surround code
    2. Single line comments: start a line with //.
    3. Comment out lines of code: Command + /
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
    A variable is like a box and it can only hold one item. We can have multiple boxes. The first box is called Story Time. We put your favorite book in that box and save it for later. There is a second box called Sleepy Time and we'll put 'Good Night Moon' in there so we can read it tonight. We will read your favorite book when you ask for the Story Time box.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
    Facebook asks for these variables when logging in: username, password, rememberLogIn. 
      * The username and password are string types. 
      * The rememberLogIn describes the check box that asks if you want to remain logged in. This would store a boolean, true for checked/false for empty.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
    I learned to use concatenation to join strings and variables together with the plus sign to form a complete string.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
    When I use Indeed to search for jobs, the developers could've used concatenation to filter and narrow down my searches. For example: when I search surgery scheduler, the webpage search engine would browse for positions with  "surgery" + "scheduler".
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? 
    Where would you use interpolation in an app or site? When would you use null or undefined in your code?
