## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I really appreciated these blog posts, especially the Turing guide on asking questions. I usually wait too long to ask questions, but can sometimes thoughtlessly ask very unnecessary questions. I love the "rubber duck" tactic, the 20-30 minute rule, and the clarity and specificity in the question-composition from the Turing guide. I'll be mindfully implementing these moving forward!

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

I learned about three primitive data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and Booleans. Numbers denote all numbers, including negative numbers and decimals. Strings denote a character or combination of characters, which can include numbers, so long as the characters are wrapped in "quotes" or 'quotes'. Finally, Booleans evaluate whether data is true or false, and I think they're more connected to comparison operators.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

log.console("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Either // double slashes
or
/* slash asterisk asterisk slash */

A code comment allows you to explain your program, how it works, your intentions behind it, or anything else you think would be helpful to include for someone else using your code!


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable represents temporary information. That information can change, but the operations performed on the variable do not.

To a 5 year old: a variable holds information that can change, something that varies, like what you eat for dinner. One night it might be pasta, the next it might be chicken. What you eat for dinner changes. An operation describes something that happens to the variable, no matter what information it holds. Regardless of whether dinner is pasta or chicken or something different, you always eat it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I am thinking of YouTube using variables for your name, email, and number of views associated with a video. I would guess strings, strings, and numbers, respectively. I'm sure they use a Boolean when you log in, though!

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Joining two or more strings and/or numbers.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Funnily enough, this makes me think of SmartChild and SmarterChild from AIM. I remember interacting with these bots and being asked my name, my favorite color, etc. and the bots would respond with, "Hi Tori who loves blue" or something along those lines! I imagine they were using concatenation!

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am little confused about the JavaScript reserved keywords "true" and "false." It seems to me that the other keywords, namely console.log() and var, relate directly to commands (output a message to the console, declare a variable), but I struggling to see the specific task we are asking the computer to perform from "true" and "false." I feel that they're related to booleans, but are they only boolean values or do they have some sort of command associated with them?
