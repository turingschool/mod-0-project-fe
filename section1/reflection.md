## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I do tend to wait because I learn better when seeking out answers for myself.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Boolean: is it true or false.
Number: it is a number
String: you want this to appear as words and language rather than the other data types.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

'''console.log("Hello World!")'''


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Three backslashes will commment out code. You can also put code between a slash and an asterisk. Code comments
are helpful for taking notes on what a section of code was put there for.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a stand-in for something else. You can make another name for a kind of data.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Twitter.
Strings: input your tweet
Number: follower count
Boolean: when displaying if someone is following you or not when visiting a profile, they might run a boolean test to get true or false and can then display the correct button as a result.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Displaying two parts together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

In a welcome message, they might say "Hello" + (user) to offer a greeting tailored to the site's visitor.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

What are the industry standards for using concatenation vs. interpolation.
