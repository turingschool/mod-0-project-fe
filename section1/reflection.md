## Section 1 Reflection

1. **Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?**
I tend to wait too long to ask. I try hard to make sure I've checked everywhere for the answer I need because I don't like feeling like an inconvenience to others. It is good to be thorough, but sometimes, I wait too long. I end up getting frustrated, which makes me feel like I'm running out of time, so I feel like trying to ask a good question and waiting for an answer will take too long.

2. **What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.**
  * STRING- Letters, numbers, and other special characters, including emojis and punctuation marks, wrapped inside single or double quotation marks. Either type of quotation marks is ok, but they have to be the same at the beginning and end
  * NUMBER- All numbers not in quotes. It can be decimals or negative numbers, but commas are not used
  * BOOLEAN- In place of yes/no answers in the form of true/false

3. **How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?**
`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. **What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?**
// for single line comments and /* text */ for multi-line comments. The purpose of a code comment is include details and explanations that we don't want logged to the console. It could also be for broken or unused code.

5. **In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?**
A variable is used when we need to change the data of value. It allows us to change this data flexibly and often. If I were to explain it to a 5 year old, I might compare it to a glass holding a drink. The glass is like the variable, and the drink is the value. The drink can be changed at any time to a different drink.

6. **Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?**
On Reddit, string is used for the name of a subreddit. Number is used for the amount of upvotes on a post. Boolean is used when asked if you want to exit without saving or uploading a post you are in the middle of composing.

7. **In your own words, explain what concatenation is.**
Concatenation allows us to log a string containing string and variables to the console. Within the string, you use a `+` to combine smaller string and variables with assigned values, which will then form a complete sentence.  

8. **Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?**
On the Chase banking app, the developers use concatenation in statements updating the balance in your checking account i.e.
`var amount = 200`
`console.log("You have $" + amount + " in your checking account.")`

9. **What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)**
I am still curious about when would be a better time to use concatenation vs. interpolation. I am also still having a little trouble wrapping my head fully around booleans and how to utilize them effectively when defining variables and logging to the console.
