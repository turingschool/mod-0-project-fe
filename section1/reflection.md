## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I've been asking a lot of questions too early vs. spending more time problem solving in my own time. For instance today I asked a really redundant question in slack, I got the answer I was looking for by simply following the directions closely on the project. If I simply followed the directions to the 'T' as it requested, I wouldn't have had to use slack to ask something so silly. Google has also been a significant resource when trying to find out cool new ways to use javascript.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* __STRING__: Is an object or objects that represents a sequence of character values. *For Instance*: "hello" is a string containing a sequence of characters 'h' 'e' 'l' 'l' and 'o'.
* __NUMBER__: Numbers is a data type that essentially means exactly what it's name entails. It handles all the number data which includes negative numbers and decimals.
* __BOOLEAN__: Is the data type that evaluates one of the two values: `true` or `false`. They are very helpful with yes/no questions. *For Instance*: you can ask your computer a numerical question, and it should give you the provided `true` or `false.`
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```
console.log("Hello World!");
```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
* // Two backslashes for single line comments
/* And a backslash with a multiplication symbol wrapped up like so to do a multiple line comment*/
Javascript will ignore all text following these symbols, as such, will not interfere with the preexisting code. Often times developers need to inform others of their intentions and their reasoning when coding, and these comments allow us to send information to other developers in a written spoken language. It could even be used as a warning about broken code, or what needs to be added or omitted.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* It's basically little data container that saves the values during programming. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type, and quantity of the value it can hold.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
* **FaceBook**:
* **PROFILE**: would likely use strings and numbers to formulate my page for both my name, and age.
* **NEWSFEED**: STRINGS, and NUMBERS. Each post contains any number of strings and numbers.
* **ADVERTISEMENT**: STRINGS, NUMBERS, and BOOLEANS. I know they use these (STRINGS & NUMBERS) data types to formulate what may interest the users in correlation with advertisement-but I'm not sure if BOOLEANS are inclusive. If they were I'm sure it would be due to your ability to block certain advertisements from showing up, the app would recognize you do not want to see it through a `true` or `false` question.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
* It essentially means 'joining together'.  You can basically just link strings together in javascript using the (+) operator, and you'll be able to add things together. This includes NUMBERS and STRINGS.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
* **FaceBook** advertisements likely use concatenation in a way that formulates what a user may be interested in. They likely take personal data, keywords used in prior posts, and general location to personalize a specific add.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* I guess I would like someone to help me with defining these terms better. Something you would say to a 5 year old, which would make it a little easier to jot down in my notebook.
