## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
Yes. depending on how stressed out or overwhelmed I am, I can either dig away at a problem alone for hours to no avail, or give up immediately and cry for help. for HW1 & 2 especially I was confused and felt dumb so I reached out right away. After i left it alone a while and came back and started over, i reread some parts i missed and it was smoother sailing from that point.
I feel fine asking questions, once i give myself permission to need help.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
strings - a static sequence of characters
numbers - the opposite of letters; math-able
Boolean - simple mathematical data states; true/false, greater/less than, etc.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// two backslashes
/* or closed with these things */
comments are to help you and other devs undestand the point of a piece of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
"a variable is a box you can put stuff (data) in. the contents can change but the box stays the same. anyone can point to the box and get the stuff out."

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

i use reddit too much. variables are probably usernames, kharma, when your Cake Day is.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
linking data together in a chain to deliver information

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
i wonder if it's used in Signal or other messengers. "this user sends X message to Y groups"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) i don't have Qs this stuff really rides the line between exciting and boring.
