## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to wait a while before asking a question, during which time I'll attempt to figure it out myself.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Integers: These are numbers. They hold quantitative data.

Strings: These are phrases. You can type anything in a string. It's basically a
collection of characters you can log to the console.

Booleans: This refers to data in a true or false sense. "On/Off"

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log(`"Hello World!"`)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// You would use the double-forward-slash to comment out a line in JS.
// This is useful for describing functions that future developers might read.
// It's also useful for deactivating a piece of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a place-holder for something that we don't know yet or that could change. Like your age or how tall you are.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Tinder.
Name: String
Age: Integer
Show Age?: Boolean

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the process of "plugging in" declared variables to a string.
It utilizes the plus (+) operator between sections of strings.

console.log("I am " + age + " years old.")

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

My Wells Fargo app says, "Hello, Nicholas!" when I login. I assume the variable of "firstName" is being concatenated to a standard greeting string.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

None at this point!
