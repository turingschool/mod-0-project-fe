## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I think I used to ask them too soon or somewhere in between. After reading the blog posts I decided to try to find a answer before asking and it is working very well for me. I will keep doing that. Thank you for the tip! :)

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

In this section we learned about 3 fundamental data types: Number, String and Boolean.
- Number: it is all numbers (including decimals, negatives). Large numbers don't use commas or points.
- String: it is the letters and other characters (including emojis, $%#, numbers) within quotes.
- Boolean: are values that can be true or false. Usually are validation of data values to determine if the script will run or not.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var name = "World";

console.log("Hello " + name + "!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

The character I would use is //.
The purpose of the comment is to explain to you and/or others developers what/how/why you did that part of the code. So later on if something happens we can understand the logic for that piece.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

Variable is a data that stores value so we don't need to type a long value over and over again.
Explanation for kids: Variable it is like a container, where you can store objects. You can store 3 apples inside it now, and tomorrow when you need to find apples again, you don't need to search your entire room, you can just grab the container and it will be there.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I think the var used in websites or apps I use are: the font size, the background color, the style of the font...

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

They probably use to display your name, location, the weather...

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I think that I did understand the concepts but I need some real world examples so I can visualize it better, show us a real website and point some of the thing we learned there.
