## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
 * I feel that I am somewhere in between.  I'm naturally very inquisitive about something but I want to see if I can discover the answer to my question first.  Learning how to get over the obstacle myself really helps me retain the material.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The three __data types__ that I learned about are:
+ ###number
 * any positive and negative number and doesn't have quotations.
+ ###string
 * is any series of characters that are between quotation marks.
+ ###boolean
 * is defining where a value is true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
//
var greeting = "Hello";
var recipient = "World";
var goodMorningMessage = `${greeting} ${recipient}!`

console.log(goodMorningMessage);
//

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
 * you would use two foward slashes to indicate comments.  the purpose of a code comment could be to provide information for other developers or to temporarily keep certain code from running

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
 * a variable allows me to store a value or data in a javascript program.  Like a container to store things in to keep track of.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
 * I use a Division 2 build site pretty often and it uses number for determining the damage amount, string for the name of the weapon, and boolean determines if that damage is justified if a talent is activated.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
 * Concatenation is joining together variables using the + operator to create sentences.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
 * I think Instagram probably uses concatenation to create sentences that say how many followers someone has.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) After each exercise that I worked on i was committing it to Git and then pushing it to GitHub.  Should I have waited to the end of the section to just commit and push all of what I modified?
