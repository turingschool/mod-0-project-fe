## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

+ I tend to be somewhere in between. If I feel like the issue is with the code or syntax I've written, I prefer to try to debug it by myself, but if the issue is not knowing where to start or not having a direction to solve a problem, I can tend to ask questions right away. Having the standard of working for 30 minutes on the issue before seeking help is a very useful tool for me.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

+ **Number** - any character that is a numerical value (whole number, decimals, negative numbers).
+ **String** - a series of characters enclosed in matching quotation marks (either single or double).
+ **Boolean** - what can be assigned to a true or false answer.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

+ `console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

+ `// `
+ code comments are used to annotate sections of code to make reading or explaining them easier, either to yourself or to other developers.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

+ A variable is like a little box in which you store and label certain types of data to use later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Facebook
```
var loginName = "Example" (string)
var correctPassword = true (boolean)
var loginsToday = 1 (number)
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

+ **Concatenation** is using previously defined variables to create a string data type in the console log by using `+`.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

+ On any app that uses custom, private account for their users (eg: a food delivery platform)
`"Welcome back Scott Gaines!"`.

```
var firstName = "Scott"
var lastName = "Gaines"

console.log("Welcome Back " + firstName + " " + lastName + "!")
```

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

+ None at this time! It's all making sense.
