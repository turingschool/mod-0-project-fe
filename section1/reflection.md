## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I have a history of waiting too long to ask questions, but am getting into the habit of asking sooner.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Numbers: Numbers represent number that you would use for your data, using decimal format.
Strings: A group of words or variables together.
Boolean: Data that is either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello world!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// You would use code comments to explain any of the code that needs detail.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a piece of data to be included in a code. It can indicate anything from a number to an object.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

eBay would definitely use number variables. I could see it using Boolean when you put a bid in on an item, to determine if it is higher than the current bid. It most likely uses string variables to welcome you back when you log in.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Linking together variables for a code.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I think eBay could use it when it's compiling search results and says "Your search for XXX returned XXX results."

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I don't understand what the advantage of concatenation vs interpolation is. It seems to me that they're pretty much the same, just a perference.
