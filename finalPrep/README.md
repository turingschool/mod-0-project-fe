# Final Prep

Congrats on making it to the Final Prep section of your Mod 0 Project! The work done in this section will directly support your readiness for the first day and weeks of Mod 1! Complete the final exercises below and be sure to carefully follow the Pull Request steps to submit your work.

### Refactor Previous Work

You've learned A LOT over the last few weeks as it relates to technical content - chances are, you probably have some code from your previous exercises that is either sloppy, incorrect, poorly named, etc. Before starting Mod 1, we want you to **refactor** your code - which is the process of adjusting or improving your code for readability and accuracy.

Some things to consider as you refactor include...
- Are variable names easy to understand/convey the data type they are assigned to?
- Do all lines of code have proper indentation? Is white space used appropriately and consistently, to promote readability?
- Are proper conventions for capitalization, punctuation, casing, etc. used?

Take your time as you go back and refactor your exercises from each section. We've included a handy checklist for you to go through below.

- [X] I have refactored my `section1` exercises to the best of my ability
- [X] I have refactored my `section2` exercises to the best of my ability
- [X] I have refactored my `section3` exercises to the best of my ability

### Gearing Up for Gear Ups

Gear Up is a part of our curriculum where we talk about topics such as privilege and power, and ethical issues in the tech industry.

### Time Management Prep

In Mod 0 you've learned about different techniques for managing your time at Turing. Please create a calendar for your **first 3 weeks of Mod 1**. Feel free to make your calendar fit your style, but we suggest that your calendar should include the following:
- [X] Standard Mod 1 class schedule (find the Mod 1 calendar [on the Front End curriculum site](https://frontend.turing.edu/))
- [X] Study/Project work time (usually about 25 hours/week outside of class time)
- [X] Personal, Health + Wellness

When you are finished, add screenshots of your calendar so we can provide feedback if needed!

### Group Work Prep

As part of Turing's project-based learning approach, you will often be working in pairs or larger groups. In order to set yourself (and your team) up for success, it is important to ensure you are prepared to be an equitable contributor and teammate.

## Next Steps

As you wrap up Mod 0, this is an important time to take care of life things such as doctor appointments, dog park trips, quality time with friends and family, etc. It is also important that you maintain the knowledge and skills you acquired during Mod 0 and this project. You can absolutely do both, but to do so successfully, **you need a plan**. We recommend spending, on average, 1-2 hours a day coding (totally 20-40 hours of time).

What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...
- What are you going to work on? [Resources here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fe-m1-practice)
- What days are you going to work?
- What times on those days are you going to work?
- Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?
- Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?
- Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)
- What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

## Extensions

Check out our thoughts on [extension activities](https://mod0.turing.io/prework/extensions) if you find yourself with some extra time before starting Mod 1!
