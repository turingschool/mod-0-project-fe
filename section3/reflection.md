## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel? I felt alright, except for the ending portion of the segment on loop-arrays.js I had struggled for over an hour to try and piece of semblance f code together in order to succeed. Unfortunately, all I ended up doing is wasting time. I eventually reached out to wait for a response, and simply continued on to finish the rest of my assignments.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
I'm sure anything from facebook, to instagram, and even spotify uses an array of lists. Facebook likely lists newsfeed or my personal data, on my profile Instagram has a list of my photos, and also my own profile information. Spotify uses a list of songs form a single album.
3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a function built into javascript that we can apply to our arrays. Each method is unique has a unique function that performs a change in our array and saves us from writing common functions.
4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
Similar to array functions, loops help us from writing long blocks of code individually. Instead of writing a count down from 1000, you could code a loop, which will conduct this method freely. This saves the developer some time to focus on other feats.
5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
I would explain it as something that checks whether or not what I want to run is true. If it is, what I'm working on will run it again. It will keep doing this until whatever I wrote is false.
6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I don't have any other questions about arrays and loops.
