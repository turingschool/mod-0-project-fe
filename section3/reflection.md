## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
  It felt challenging and satisfying! I enjoy solving puzzles, and this felt like solving a productive puzzle.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  I use the Spotify app daily, and I can see ways in which arrays might be used within this app. For example, I have several playlists saved under my username, and these playlist names might be shown as elements with the playlist array associated with my account. Going further, each song could be shown as an element within each individual playlist array.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  An array method is a command or instruction that you give that will do something to the designated array. For example, pop() is a method that you can give that will instruct the computer to remove the last element in the specified array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  A loop is a set of instructions that will continue to run as long as the condition checked is **true**. When the condition is false, it will stop running. What the condition is and what code is executed when **true** is up to you when writing the loop. Ultimately, you could achieve the same thing by writing out the code as many times as you want the loop to perform, but writing it in the loop format is more efficient and saves you a lot of time!

  We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we want to run through a specific, predetermined set of data.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  If I was teaching the concept of loops to a 5 year old, I would pick a simple question and demonstrate how that would apply to a classroom.
    * Let's say that there are ten students in your class. We want to ask each student if they are hungry and then make a decision based on their answer.
    * We know that we only need to ask this question 10 times in total, so let's not ask it more than that.
    * Starting with the first student we'll say: "Are you hungry?"
    * If they say yes, we'll treat that as **true** and decide what our action should be from there.
    * We decide that this is their action when hungry = true: They are hungry = give them a snack!
    * If the answer is no, we don't do anything except move on to the next student in line.
    * When we have asked this question 10 times, we stop asking. Our work is done!

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  * I'm excited to see how these interact even more deeply with other concepts. The *if statement* inside of a loop was a fun challenge, and I know that it will only become more complicated!
