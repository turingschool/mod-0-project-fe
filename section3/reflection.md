## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

+ It was daunting at times, but also empowering knowing I had the resources at my disposal, especially when I was able to pinpoint issues or discover what needed to be done on my own.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

+ The chipotle app, or any other online food ordering platform, could use an array to list the ingredients available to add to an order.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

+ Array methods are code used to perform specific tasks on a given array (such as: remove the data point at the first index in the array, or add the following data points to the end of the array, etc).

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

+ A loop is used to run a specific block of code repeatedly, or a specified number of times. It can be used with an array if there is a block of code that needs to be run against each data point in the array before returning a specific log and moving on to the next piece of data.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

+ Say we're putting letters into envelopes. We have a large stack of letters, but only a small stack of envelopes. For each envelope, we would perform the same routine, or loop, of folding the letter, sliding it into the envelope, licking and sealing the envelope, and putting in a stack before moving onto the next envelope. Once we've filled all the envelopes, we're done!

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

+ No questions, I just need to continue practicing to completely wrap my head around them.
