## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

I'm growing to really appreciate this "slowly-remove-the-training-wheels" approach and have been intentionally leaning into self-reliance as a result. So, it felt pretty good!

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I am thinking of Amazon and any other site that uses a shopping cart. I imagine arrays play a role in creating the list of items stored within the shopping cart... I imagine they also play a role in displaying the results of searching for an item, now that I'm thinking of it - especially if there are a limited number of results per page! There must be an array method (or a more complex extrapolation of one!) at work to display a limited number of results!

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

A method is a function that can be used on or applied to certain objects, of which an array is one. Therefore, an array method is a function specific to arrays that, when applied, performs a some change or calculation - like removing the first or last element and returning said element, for example.   

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops grant programmers access to infinity - an otherwise unrealistic, unattainable outcome. Said another way, loops instruct a program to perform an action a specific number of times, but only require the programmer to write code for that action once, regardless of the size of said number. Whether or not you choose to use a loop in conjunction with an array depends on the kind of data you are interested in manipulating. If you want a program to perform an action on a single value a specific amount of times, then you do not use a loop in conjunction with an array; however, if you have a collection of data and want the program to perform an action on multiple values in that collection, then you do use a loop in conjunction with an array.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Think about brushing your teeth. When I tell you to brush your teeth, you know that what I'm actually asking you to do is put toothpaste on your toothbrush, put your toothbrush in your mouth, and then move your toothbrush up and down over each tooth until you've brushed them all. This is an example of something you do that requires you to repeat the same thing, or perform the same action, over, and over, and over again. Our brains are amazing and can understand when one activity, like toothbrushing, requires us to repeat an action multiple times; however, computers are not like our brains. They cannot understand that an action should be performed multiple times during certain activities without being told to perform that specific action each and every time. Said another way, where I can tell you to simply "brush your teeth," I would have to tell a computer to put toothpaste on its toothbrush, put the toothbrush in its mouth, move up on its first tooth, move down on its first tooth, and then move up on its second tooth, and move down on its second tooth, etc. until I instructed it to brush every single tooth it has! As you can imagine, writing each and every instruction a computer needs to brush its teeth would be exhausting! Loops allow programmers to write an instruction once instead of multiple times, and they tell the computer to repeat that instruction until it produces what we want - clean teeth, in this example!

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I know that I encounter loops in conjunction with arrays often in my life as a regular user of the internet; however, while I feel as though I understand their language/syntax/output in the context of this project so far, I am having a harder time seeing them in practical, everyday use. What are common examples of (what I'm guessing are) more complex but more frequently utilized loops in conjunction with arrays in familiar apps?
