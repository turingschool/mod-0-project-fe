## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

  Utilizing my resources and support felt comforting, this was the first time I was actually stuck and spent more than 30 minutes on a problem. However after reaching out to fellow classmates and friends it was nice knowing there are people willing to help. The gratification of finding information on my own and working through problems with out looking at previous sessions were well worth the struggle.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  Developers for food delivery applications will create arrays based on a multiple values. For example an array can be created with a variable of "Order Again." Within that variable will be a collection of restaurants( or elements) the user has ordered from in the past.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  An array method is the process of creating a macro variable, within that macro variable are micro elements each having their own identifier( or index.)

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  The purpose of a loop is to track and test multiple conditions based on a set of rules the user has declared, not stoping until it has found a true value. The purpose of using a loop in conjunction with an array is to test the condition with all of the elements inside of the array while keeping the code organized. Using a loop without an array is best for testing individual elements on a smaller scale.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  If you are playing a video game and are currently on level 5, but you want to beat the game which doesn't happen until level 10, you continue trying.
  This is the beginning of the loop, the condition is you won't quit until you beat the game at level 10, every time you repeat the level you gain a little more experience that helps you move up in levels. Eventually you will be successful and win the game. ðŸŽ‰

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  If an array is constantly logging new information, and your loop is set to run through all of the variables, what would be the conditional log command to pull a random element from the array?

For example how would I be able to determine who is the randomized winner from this Syntax:

```javascript
var entries = ["Jim", "Bob", "Mo", "Larry"]

for (i = 0; i < entries.length; i++)

console.log("Congratulations " + ``entries[i]`` + " you won!")
```
