## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

Felt confident, had to do a little more leg work to find good resources to explain further until it clicked.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Storing user data like login, password, any posts the user may make. It is helpful to use arrays to store data that
has something in common.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method tells us how to access and manage data stored within a defined array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop can repeat a function as many times as specified so that less needs to be done manually. A loop would be
used in conjunction with an array when the same function should be applied multiple times.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

We can do the same thing over and over again when we use a loop.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
