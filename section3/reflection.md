## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

I came up on similar road blocks as usual but i made it thru.
some of the resources i found online had outdated terms and wrong information. it was hard to know what's legit or not. that's true with the entire internet tho.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

reddit keeps track of all your posts, your comments on posts, and your comments on comments

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

when you alter an array after it has been established.
.push, .pop, splice, etc.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

loops are for repeating iterative processes
you can use a loop with an array when you want to take an action on some or all of the items within the Array.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

i don't know any five year olds, so i don't know what they understand as a frame of reference. microwaves? when you put your dino nuggies in the microwave and push a button, it adds heat and counts down. for every second that it counts down it adds more heat and minuses one second until it reaches zero. then it dings your nuggies are done.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

i know this is something i will have to practice and explore.
