## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

* I'm glad because it forces me to make sure I'm actually learning how to do something instead of just copying down what I need to do. I think it will help me be better.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* A good example of the use of arrays would be on any social media platform. You will have a friends list and those people who you are friends with will most likely be stored in an array.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An array is a method where you can store multiple items like a list. I think of it as a simple piece of paper you jot down things onto and can reference at any time by looking at the paper. It could be a shopping list, to do list, or a bucket list as an example.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* The purpose of a loop is to repeat the same or similar code a set number of times.

* You would use a loop in conjunction with an array if you want to quickly access all elements in an array. You could use a loop without an array if you wanted to log counting to ten without having an array with 1-10 in it.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* A loop in programming is like designing a loop in a roller coaster you set up the length of the ride, how many people are allowed on the ride each time, and how many times you want them to go through a loop on the track. Once the ride is open, the ride will run with these set instructions until it reaches the end.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* Are we going to cover other types of loops?
