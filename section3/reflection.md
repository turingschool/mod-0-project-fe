## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

*I could definitely feel the added pressure to do things on our own. Although it took me some time, I feel that the concepts are more strongly imbedded when we are forced to remember something or figure it out ourselves.*

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

*I find an array of pizza places near me on Google Maps.*

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

*An array method is an action or function that does something to the data in a specified array.*

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

*A loop performs an action a specific number of times. We would use a loop with an array if we wanted to return each item in the array one after another.*

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

*A loop is a thing that happens as many times as we want.*

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

*I want to know more about "While" and "Do while" loops.*
