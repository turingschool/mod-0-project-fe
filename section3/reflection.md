## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
It felt challenging but I was able to complete the section. I like to explore and understand the contents, so was pretty smooth.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
The tags on Instagram. You place a tag on the search bar and will search in all the user's posts for posts that contain that tag.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array is a variable that can store a list of values under a single variable name.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop help us to execute a block of codes for a number of times. We use a loop in conjunction with an array when we want to execute a specific action in all the elements from the array, and we use a loop without an array when we need to repeat a string/number until a condition is met.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is an action that check a condition and then run a code block. The loop will continue to check and run until the condition is false.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I understand the theory for loops and arrays, but I don't really know where I would apply those. I know that we are starting with the basics, but not being able to se it in the real world makes me very lost.
