## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

At times, tough. I used google a decent amount and asked questions. It felt really good when you get it though.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Google could use arrays as it lists pages based on searches.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a function that you can apply to your array so that you can manipulate it how you want.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to run a code multiple times and/or to test a condition multiple times. You'd want to use a loop in conjuction with an array when you'd want to access every element of an array. You don't need a loop when you are simply listing elements of an array.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is like a wheel. A wheel will continue to roll until something stops it. When it is rolling, everything is working properly. When it stops, it is because something made it stop.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

No questions but I know I need to practice syntax more.
