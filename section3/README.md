# Section 3 - HOW TO SPEND YOUR TIME, Arrays and Loops

Section 3 is estimated to take a total of 6-10 hours to complete. Similar to the previous sections, this section of the project involves reading (both from this document as well as the 📒John Duckett book), 👩🏻‍💻exercises, and 📝reflection questions. Make sure to manage your time well so that should you get stuck and need help, you have plenty of time to do so and meet the deadline.

Since Arrays are a bigger topic, it is the main focus of this section. Some review work from the first two sections has been woven in so you get opportunities to continue seeing and applying those concepts, as well.

## Get Set Up

Using the Terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the project repository.

## Part A: How You Spend Your Time

One challenge developers face, more-so when they are starting out, is estimating how long something will take. Sometimes we don't account for merge conflicts, bugs, annoying Slack messages, and all the other things that interrupt our workflow or slow us down.

One challenge learners in a new environment/content area face is feeling like they know nothing, and until they know everything, they feel like they are failing.

So this week, we would like you to start self-monitoring your progress. Before you start on the technical work, reflect back on how the project has gone so far.

- Have the time estimates matched up with your experience?
So far I have found that my estimates have matched up pretty closely.  I have found that I am on the lower end of the 6-10 hour window for each section but still inside this timeframe.
- When you sit down to start working, do you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish and in how much time? If so, how aligned is that to what actually happens?
When I sit down to start working I always try to have an idea of what I want to accomplish and how long I would like to be working for. Because my schedule is so jam packed with with and school right now I have to stick to exactly the schedule I have laid out.  If I short my time working on something I have little ability to catch back up
- How do you work best - in 2 hour blocks, 4 hour blocks, etc? Do you take breaks regularly? Do you have a system to hold yourself accountable to taking breaks?
Right now I have mostly been working in 2 hour blocks or something close to this.  This has helped as I dont feel like I have been working on something for too long and I feel like I am still fully engaged in what I am learning.  If I tried to push this longer I fear I would lose productivity

You've probably heard of the Pomodoro Technique in Mod 0 classes (and elsewhere, maybe!). During this final section of the project, we are going to ask that you follow this technique. Please read about it [here](https://www.dovico.com/blog/2020/08/26/the-pomodoro-technique-how-to-manage-your-work-time-and-flow-the-easy-way/).

The article doesn't mention writing down Step 1 (`Decide on the task to be performed`), but we ask that you find a special spot in your notebook where you do this for each work session. In the deliverables, we will ask that you share what you wrote down for Step 1 of the technique each time you started a new task.

_Note: if the 25 minutes on/3-5 minutes off isn't best for you, you do **not** have to follow that! The main focus of this is setting an intention and continuing to better understand your working style._

## Part B: Arrays

📒 Read pages 70 and 72 in the `JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY: Interactive Front-End Web Development` book.

🎬 Watch [this video to hear an explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUnV-fCY0Pc) and watch someone apply some of the concepts you read about in the book. The person who recorded this video is writing JavaScript in the browser Developer Tools. Open them with in Chrome with the keyboard shortcut `command + option + i`, and click Console.

Research the array methods below on the MDN documentation provided. This documentation might seem intimidating at first, but you will need to get comfortable looking at it.

👩🏻‍💻 Create a file in your `section3` directory called `arrayMethods.md` and describe, in your own words, what each method does.

* Methods to research: `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `unshift`. Take a look at the [MDN documentation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). Hint: the methods are listed in a column on the left hand side of the website.
* _Note: The MDN documentation makes use of the variable declarations `const` and `let`. For now, just read them as `var` instead._

> 👩🏻‍💻 PAUSE here, and complete the exercises in `arrays.js`

## Part C: Loops

Sometimes, we want our program to perform an action a specific number of times. A loop is a way to only write the code for that action 1 time, but instruct our program to carry it out `n` times. (`n` being a placeholder for theoretically any positive whole number. [Read more about that here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-n-symbol-in-math) if you are interested and/or not familiar with that!)

Sometimes, we have a collection of data (like an array) and we want to perform an action on each item in that collection. In these instances, we need to iterate through each piece of data in our collection.

Work through this section to build your understanding of how `for` loops can be used both with and without Arrays.

### For Loops

📒 Read pages 170-174 of the `JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY: Interactive Front-End Web Development` book.

🎬 Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9wW2PpJsmQ) to hear an explanation and see someone write a `for` loop! Remember, when you see `let`, pretend it is `var`. You will learn the differences between those, at a very deep level, in Mod 2.

> 👩🏻‍💻 PAUSE here, and complete the exercises in `loops.js`

### For Loop and Arrays

🎬 Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxFi7vVZx4s) to learn about using `for` loops with Arrays. The first 18 minutes cover for loops and at around 18 minutes in, the video gets into using them with Arrays. Watch what feels helpful to you! (At 23 minutes, the video covers looping over Objects which is _not_ aligned to the learning goals of this section, so we advise stopping there.)

## Reflection

📝 Answer the questions in the `reflection.md` file in the `section3` directory.

## Commit Your Work in Git

When you are finished with all of the `section3` activities, use the Git workflow and commands you've learned to add and commit your work. Write a commit message that concisely summarizes what work this commit contains. Use your resources if you need a refresher on how to do this.

## Push to GitHub

Push your code to your remote repository. Visit your GitHub repository to verify the work you did for this section was pushed successfully!
