# Array Methods

- *Pop method*- When the pop method is used, the last element in an array is removed. The next time the array is called, it will show the remaining elements in the console. When array.pop() is run, the element that has been removed will display in the console.

- *Push method*- The push method adds a new element to the end of an array. When array.push("New element") is run in the console, it shows the length of the new array with the new addition. When the array is called, it will show a new element at the end.

- *Shift method*- This method takes the array and removes the first element. Then, when array.shift() is run in the console, it will show the element that has been removed. The next time the array is called, the first element from the previous version of the array will be gone.

- *Unshift method*- This adds a new element to the beginning of an array. When run in the console with array.unshift("New element"), it shows the length of the array with the new addition. When the array is called, thew new element will show at the beginning of the array.
