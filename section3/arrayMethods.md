__Array Methods__

`pop` - Using the `pop()` method will delete the last value that is assigned in the array while also reassigning an index number to the remaining values.

`push` - Using the `push()` method will add one or more values to the end of an array. Next, the command will return the total amount of values the user currently has stored in your array.

`shift` - Using the `shift()` method will remove the first value(0) from an array and report back to the user which value was removed while also reassigning the remaining values a new index.

`unshift` - Using the `unshift()` method can add multiple new values to the the beginning of the array starting at the "0" index and reassigning the values following to a new index.
