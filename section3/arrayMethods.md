Array Methods

Pop- When the pop method is used, the last element in an array is removed. The next time the array is called, the last element will be gone. When pop is run, the element that is to be removed will display in the console.

Push- The push method adds a new element to the end of an array. When run in the console, it shows the length of the new array.

Shift method- This takes the array and removes the first element. Then, when it is run in the console, it will show the element that has been removed.

Unshift method- This adds a new element to the beginning of an array. When run in the console, it shows the length of the array with the new addition.
