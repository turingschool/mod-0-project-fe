  * written like `Array.push();`

3. `shift` - this method allows you to remove the **first** element of an array and will return what was removed. Inherently updates the length.
  * written like `Array.shift();`

4. `unshift` - this method allows you to add one or more elements to the front of the array, inherently adjusting each element's index by 1 to the right. It will return the new length of the array.
