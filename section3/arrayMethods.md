- Pop method will remove the last element from the array list. you can simply remove it or you can remove it so that the element will print in the console using console.log(array.pop());

- Push method will add any number of elements to an array. If the line:
array.push(3, 4, 5);, then 3,4,5 will be added to said array. by adding console.log to the beginning of the line of code, you will print the length of the array.

- Shift will remove that first element from an array list by the same method as the two above: array.shift();

- You can add elements to the beginning of an array using Unshift method by using the same format as the 3 other methods above.
