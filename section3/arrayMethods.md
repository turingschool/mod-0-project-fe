**Pop** - `pop ()` removes the last element of a given array. In doing so, the length of the array is shortened,
and the value of that element is returned.
**Push** - `push ()` adds one or more elements to the end of an array. The length of the array is lengthened by how many
elements are added.
**Shift** - `shift ()` removes the first element in an array. In doing so, the length of the array is shortened,
and values of the follow indexes are shifted down.
**Unshift** - `unshift ()` adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array. The length of the array is lengthened
by how many elements are added.
