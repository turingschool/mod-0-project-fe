//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push('Lemur');

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals[2] = "Elephant";
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['apples', 'almonds', 'ice cream', 'waffles'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push('broccoli');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push('chocolate', 'dumplings', 'walnuts');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: In Spotify, my personal list of playlists could be stored in an array. Each holds
// complex data and many songs, but they are all the same 'kind' of element.
// 2: Within my Spotify playlists, the songs I've added could be listed in arrays as well.
//Each playlist would have its own array of songs, and each array would store the data associated
//with each song.
// 3: I also you the website Goodreads to keep track of my books. On this site, there could
//be an array showing each book read in 2021, and the data associated with each title.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

//We are checking to see if the user's phone battery life is greater than or equal to 15%
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
//If battery levels okay, return that they CAN call an uber
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
//If batter levels were not okay, the computer will move on to the next condition. In this case,
//are both of these conditions met: 1. they have a charger 2. it is a car charger
} else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
//If both conditions are met here, then they can call an uber
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
//If neither of these conditions are met, return the default statement
} else {
//The default statement is that the user CANNOT call an Uber
  console.log("You cannot call an Uber, sorry!");
};


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
