Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

Make sure to run the file with node in your command line.

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla"
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Penguin"
// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals[2] = "Elephant"
console.log(animals[2])

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = [ "Tacos", "Chips","Salsa","Guac" ]

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length)

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli")
console.log(foods)

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop()
console.log(foods)
// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push("queso", "pico de gallo", "jalapenos")
console.log(foods)
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift()
console.log(foods)
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: friend list
// 2: followers
// 3: following


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// Lines 115-116 are setting up a conditional where there is also a logical operator used. The conditions that
// these lines are setting up is: If the variable percentBatteryLeft is greater that or equal to 15
// OR the variable hasCharger is equal to true AND chargerTypeis equal to "car",
// then console log "You can call an Uber!"
if ((percentBatteryLeft >= 15) || ((hasCharger == true) && (chargerType == "car"))) {
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
// Lines 122-123 are setting up an else if conditional, meaning that if the conditional set up on line 115
// fails, the the computer will move on to this second conditional. The else if conditional is
// asking the conditions: if the variable percentBatteryLeft is less than 15 OR the variable hasCharger
// is equal to false AND the variable chargerType is not equal to "car", then to console log the string
// "You cannot call an Uber!"
} else if ((percentBatteryLeft < 15) || ((hasCharger == false) && (chargerType !== "car"))) {
  console.log("You cannot call an Uber!");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
