//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length)
// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Owl";
console.log(animals);
// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push("Elephant"); //can be done with the push or unshift method to have this item appear in the array
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['ice cream', 'fries', 'chocolate', 'burger'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length)

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.unshift('broccoli'); //this method should add broccoli to the beginning of the array
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop()
console.log(foods)
// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array. 
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push('hot dog', 'apple', 'banana'); //this method adds these elements to the end of the array
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or 
// all from the same one.

// 1: Netflix: they list genres you can select from (ex: drama, action, comedy)
// 2: Duolingo: they list the different languages you can choose to learn (german, spanish, korean)
// 3: Spotify: you can create a soundtrack that lists song titles and the artist (Agaculpa by Jason Derulo, When I'm Gone by Alesso)

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter 
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
function canCallUber(percentBatteryLeft, hasCharger, chargerType) {
  if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
    return "You can call an Uber!";
    // This condition requires that the user has 15% or greater on their phone battery. If this is true, this block of code is executed
  } else {
    // This condition is if the user has less than 15% on their battery. This will run the next code to evaluate what to do next.
    // I created a new if statement below because this 'else' establishes they don't have the correct percentBatteryLeft, 
    // so I am now checking for new conditions. The conditions below also have to go together in order to be true, by using the logical AND operator.
    if (hasCharger && chargerType === "car") {
      return "You can charge your phone & call Uber!";
      //This checks two conditions, does the user have a charger AND is the charger a car type. 
      //At this point, as long as both are true then this code block executes.
    } else { 
      return "You cannot call Uber."; 
      //This default would execute when all of the conditions are false.  
    }
  }
}
console.log(canCallUber(percentBatteryLeft, hasCharger, chargerType));

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
