//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.splice(2, 1, "Gorilla");
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Cats")
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push("Elephant");
console.log(animals.at(4));


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["pizza", "donut", "apple", "grape"];


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

foods.push("pasta", "coffee", "bagel");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

foods.shift();
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Facebook photo albums listed
// 2: Tik Tok storing my posts
// 3: Amazon listing items for sale by a seller

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
//This line is running a comparison between the values of variable 'percentBatteryLeft' and the number 15.
//If the value of variable 'percentBatteryLeft' is 15 or greater, then it will log to the console that
//"You can call an Uber."
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("You can call an Uber.");
//First, the 'else if' is telling the machine to run this outcome if the first 'if' is determined
//to be falsy. This code evaluates two operands, first evaluating whether the value of ""'hasCharger' is == to 'true'""
//The second is evaluating if 'chargerType' == "car". Since we are comparing different data types, I used the
//'==' operator rather than the strict '===' operator which would evaluate this to be falsy due to comparing
//different data types. The '&&' operator denotes that conditions of both operands must be true for the console
//to log its assigned string.
} else if (hasCharger == true && chargerType == "car") {
  console.log ("You can call an Uber.");
//These lines offer an alternative code to be run if the conditions of the first two are not met.
//In this case, it will log to the console "You cannot call an Uber."
} else {
  console.log("You cannot call an Uber.")
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
