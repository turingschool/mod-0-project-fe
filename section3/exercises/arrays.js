Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

Make sure to run the file with node in your command line.

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array

//animals.shift();
console.log(animals.shift());

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
var count = animals.push();
console.log(count);
// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

animals.pop();
animals.push('Gorilla');
console.log(animals);
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.unshift('Tiger');
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push('Elephant');
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var food = ['pizza', 'chicken', 'burger', 'hotdog'];
// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

var foodCount = 4;
console.log(foodCount);
// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
food.push('broccoli');
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
food.pop();
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
food.push('cake', 'tacos', 'chips');
console.log(food);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
food.shift();
console.log(food);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:Facebook you can creat a close friend list
// 2:Youtube has playlists
// 3:Blog can have posts sorted together based on their hashtags


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 11;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";


// Write your conditional here

if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  //Code executes if percentBatteryLeft is greater than or equal to 15
  console.log('Can call an uber!')
} else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 + true + "car") {
  //Code executes if percentBatteryLeft is less than 15 and true with car charger
  console.log('Can call an uber!')
} else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 + false) {
  //Code executes if percentBatteryLeft is less than 15 and is false
  console.log('Cannot call an uber!')
} else {
  //Code executes if no conditions are met
  console.log('Cannot call an uber!')
};

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
