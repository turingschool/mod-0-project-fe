//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
console.log(animals.splice(2, 1, "Gorilla"));
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
console.log(animals.push("Koala Bear"));
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

//first i would need to reassign elephant since it was kicked off the list by gorilla.
animals.splice(2,1,"Elephant");
console.log(animals)
console.log(animals[2]);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["Pizza","Sushi","Tacos","Ice Cream"];
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("Broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push("bagels", "mac n cheese", "sandwiches");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:reddit - list of posts made
// 2: - list of comments made on posts
// 3: - list of commenst made on comments

//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

 ðŸ¤¯ this is confusing because the statements in lines 112-114 directly contradict each other. It doesn't matter if they have a charger, but if they have a charger they can call a car? If the charger only works in the car, how can they use it to call the car with a dead phone? anyway...
*/

var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("User can call an Uber.")
}  else {
    console.log("User is walking home.")
}

// in this case, the code checks the battery %. if it's above the threshold, they can call an Uber. since it doesn't matter if they have a charger at all, or what type, they're walking.

//or maybe...

if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 || hasCharger && chargerType === "car") {
  console.log("User can call an Uber.")
} else {
  console.log("User is walking home.")
}

/* in this instance the code checks if the user's battery is above the call threshold OR if they have a charger AND if that charger will work in the car.
so either they have 15+% battery or they have a car charger.

if they are below threshhold and don't have a charger, or they do have a charger but it's not the right kind, they're boned.

anecdotaly, this totally happened to me in portland last winter. i went out drinking and the public transport stops around 10. around 1am, i go looking for an uber with like 5% battery. right as the driver calls me to tell me they cant find me, my phone dies. i didn't have a charger and all the shops are closed. I ended up hiding in a restaurant patio in the freezing rain. busses started back up around 8am. that sucked. moral of the story: ALWAYS carry a spare charger!
